## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (v1.0.0+) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- A Discord Bot Token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation

#### Local Installation (with Bun)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obuwunkunubi/gacha-ping.git
```

```bash
cd gacha-ping
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Copy the sample environment file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

4. Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file:

```
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"

# Command Timeouts (in seconds)
CREATE_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes
PING_TIMEOUT=60     # 1 minute
```

5. Initialize the database:

```bash
bunx drizzle-kit push
```

6. Run the bot:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

#### Docker Installation

The easiest way to run the bot is using Docker:

1. Create a new directory for the bot:

```bash
mkdir gacha-ping && cd gacha-ping
```

2. Create a `compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  gacha-ping:
    container_name: gacha-ping
    image: ghcr.io/obuwunkunubi/gacha-ping:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/db
```

3. Create an `.env` file with your Discord bot token:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"

# Command Timeouts (in seconds)
CREATE_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes
PING_TIMEOUT=60     # 1 minute
```

4. Create a data directory for the database and start the bot:

```bash
mkdir -p data
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

6. Stop the bot:

```bash
docker compose down
```

You can also use a specific version by changing the image tag to a version number like `ghcr.io/obuwunkunubi/gacha-ping:1.0.0`.

**Updating the bot:**

To update to the latest version when a new release is available:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/obuwunkunubi/gacha-ping:latest

# Restart your container
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

**Data Persistence:**

The database is stored in the `./data` volume on your host machine to ensure persistence between container restarts and updates.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The bot can be configured through environment variables:

| Variable            | Description                                | Default         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot authentication token      | Required        |
| `CREATE_TIMEOUT`    | Cooldown for creating groups (seconds)     | 300 (5 minutes) |
| `PING_TIMEOUT`      | Cooldown for pinging groups (seconds)      | 60 (1 minute)   |
| `BOT_STATUS`        | Bot's online status                        | "online"        |
| `BOT_ACTIVITY_TYPE` | Bot's activity type                        | None            |
| `BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME` | Text displayed for bot's activity          | None            |
| `BOT_ACTIVITY_URL`  | URL for streaming activity type            | None            |

### Bot Status Options

The `BOT_STATUS` variable can be set to one of the following values:
- `online` - Shows the bot as online (green dot)
- `idle` - Shows the bot as idle (yellow/orange moon)
- `dnd` - Shows the bot as Do Not Disturb (red dot)
- `invisible` - Makes the bot appear offline

### Bot Activity Options

When both `BOT_ACTIVITY_TYPE` and `BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME` are set, the bot will display an activity status. The `BOT_ACTIVITY_TYPE` can be one of:
- `playing` - "Playing [BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME]"
- `watching` - "Watching [BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME]"
- `listening` - "Listening to [BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME]"
- `streaming` - "Streaming [BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME]" (requires `BOT_ACTIVITY_URL` to be set)
- `competing` - "Competing in [BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME]"

**Important:** If `BOT_ACTIVITY_TYPE` is set to `streaming`, you **must** also set `BOT_ACTIVITY_URL` to a valid Twitch or YouTube URL. If streaming is selected but no URL is provided, the bot will fall back to showing only the status without any activity.

**Example:**
```
BOT_STATUS=dnd
BOT_ACTIVITY_TYPE=playing
BOT_ACTIVITY_NAME=with dice
```
This will show the bot as Do Not Disturb with the status "Playing with dice".

## 💻 Development

This project uses:

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) for Discord API integration
- [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with SQLite for database operations
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript/TypeScript runtime

### Database Management

You can view and manage the database using Drizzle Kit Studio. The tool is already included in the project dependencies:

```bash
# Start the Drizzle Kit Studio UI (web interface for the database)
bunx drizzle-kit studio
```

This will open a web interface where you can browse tables, run queries, and inspect data in your SQLite database.
